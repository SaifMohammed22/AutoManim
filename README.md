# Manim Automation Project

This project aims to automate [Manim](https://www.manim.community/)—a powerful math animation library—by integrating the following components:

- **Gemini 2.0 Flash:** Utilized for script generation.
- **Docker:** Runs Manim scripts inside containers, eliminating the need for a local setup.
- **Subprocess:** Executes Docker commands seamlessly.
- **Gradio:** It provides an intuitive interface to preview the generated animations.

This project simplifies the workflow of generating engaging mathematical presentations by automating the animation creation process. The integration with Docker ensures that all dependencies are managed in a controlled environment, while Gradio gives users a visually appealing way to interact with the output.

**Note**: It is incomplete; issues and hallucinations are still due to the large language model (LLM) generated scripts.
